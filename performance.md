1) Question: 
Given a hard drive with one terabyte of data, arranged in 2^32 key/value pairs, 
where the keys and values each have lengths of 128 bytes, you need to design, 
build, and deploy (by yourself) a system that lets you look up the value for 
a given key, over the internet, at a peak rate of 5000 lookups per second. 
The data never changes. Letâ€™s design that system.

Additionally:
 - you will have only 2 week until launch
 - no SSD (this question is from pre-SSD era)
 - how is your solution going to fail?
