Given a hard drive with one terabyte of data, arranged in 2^32 key/value pairs, 
where the keys and values each have lengths of 128 bytes, you need to design, 
build, and deploy (by yourself) a system that lets you look up the value for 
a given key, over the internet, at a peak rate of 5000 lookups per second. 
The data never changes. Letâ€™s design that system.

Possible answers:
*Not specified (open question)*
